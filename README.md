## Bud Technical Test

Extended from my personal Next JS / React boilerplate <br/>
repo: github.com/robinojw/next-ts-starter

Note:
Next JS uses it's own webpack config by default but see `next.config.js` <br/>
for my custom config.

Please note babel is a necessary quirk to use styled components in conjunction<br/>
with Next JS. Production is still transpiled with the configuration in<br/>
`next.config.js`.
